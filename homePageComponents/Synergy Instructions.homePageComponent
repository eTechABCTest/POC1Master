    <body>Hello and Welcome!&lt;br&gt;&lt;u&gt;Projects&lt;/u&gt;:&lt;br&gt;The Projects section contains all relevant member information and can be used as a landing page. Every Crimson application member will have an associated “Project”. Users will be able to view vendors, open member support tickets, SPD information, and contacts. The Projects section is not editable by non-Advisory Board employees.&lt;br&gt;&lt;u&gt;Member Support&lt;/u&gt;:&lt;br&gt;The Member Support page is used for transactional ticketing. Both member support issues and data load tickets are contained in this section. Member support issues can be viewed, created, and modified on this tab. Non-Advisory Board employees can view data load tickets but cannot create or modify them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;u&gt;Deployments (Milliman Only)&lt;/u&gt;:&lt;br&gt;The Deployments page tracks individual population timelines and milestones. This tab will have sections on estimated completion dates, actual completion dates, and deviations from the expected timeline. Deployments can also be used to attach population specific items such as documents and spreadsheets. This section is fully editable by the Milliman team.&lt;br&gt;&lt;u&gt;Reports (Milliman Only)&lt;/u&gt;:&lt;br&gt;The Reports page houses aggregated reports on metrics that the Advisory Board and Milliman will collectively track. Examples of these metrics are length of time to complete of a member support ticket or number of days that a deployment has been active. Reports are not editable by Milliman team. If you would like to discuss the creation of a new report, please forward the request to the Milliman Project Manager to discuss with Rachel Derr.</body>
